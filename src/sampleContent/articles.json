You might be wondering why we can’t just tell the truth and give the real reason to all three parties? Well, it’s because the truth will set you free, and we don’t want to be free, we want to be employed. Therefore, we have to give curated answers that’ll smooth the doubts of HR and management so that everyone involved can feel comfortable knowing it’s not them, it’s you.",
